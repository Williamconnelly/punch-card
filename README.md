# punch-card

## User Stories
Many restaurants provide punchcards to increase customer loyality. For example if you purchase 9 entrees at a specific restaurant the 10th purchase will be 50% off. However, these physical punchcards are easy to lose. With the punch card application, you won't have to keep track of all your different punch cards or worry about losing them. All your punch cards can be used and stoted on your user account. This will be beneficial for participating restaurants as well because their guests will be more likely to redeem their punch cards, which will increase loyality to the restaurant.

## Approach
The first thing that we did in our group was a appoint a git master. We all decided Scott was best suited for that position. After that our whole group got together and we started brainstorming on what kind of project we would make. A lot of the ideas were based off of what kind of API's were out there. When we decided what our idea was, the next step was to begin wireframing. We wireframed all of our pages and then proceeded to map out the server side routes as well as the client side routes.
